# NLP - Natural Language Processing

This is the repository for the Natural Language Processing at Asian Institute of Technology (AIT).

Google slide lectures can be found in:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14x9_-Y_aWysPIZFLaVrZE2ngy2h_beJj?usp=sharing 

For the solution of the assignments, please contact my TA information below.  I have excluded from this repository for learning purposes for my AIT students.

I would also like to give huge credits to several githubs/web resources that I have revised to create this:

- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/ (a lot of our assignments and lectures come from Manning's awesome course!)
- https://github.com/bentrevett (created an awesome github for learning NLP!)
- https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial (a simple github with very short code; good for learning)
- https://github.com/mhagiwara/100-nlp-papers (listed first 100 influential NLP papers)
- https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp (collection of all NLP learning resources)
- https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress (omg...this is like a mini wikipedia for NLP!)

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit; Office Hours: Fri. 16-17h ; Email: st121720@ait.ac.th
- Chanapa Pananookooln; Office Hours: Fri. 16-17h ; Email: st121395@ait.ac.th

If you have any questions regarding the lectures/assignments, do not hesitate to contact them in their office hours.

## Grade Criteria

The course has the following grade criteria:
1. Assignment (40%) --> 
    - There will be a total of 6 coding assignments
    - Any late work (indicated by Google Classroom) will be deducted 50%.  **NO excuses** will be accepted.
    - We are extremely serious about copying and plagiarism.  This assignment is intended for you to learn.  TA has the privilege to give zeros or partial score to any sort of plagiarism or alike.  Their call IS FINAL.
      -  A1: Getting Started (5%)

      -  A6: Pretraining BERT + finetuning (7%)
2. Final Project (45%)
    - Three default project topics will be given as follows:
      - (1) Text Summarization (Pranissa)
      - (2) Pretraining + Fineturning on Intent Classification (Sitiporn)
      - (3) Social Media Depression (Chanapa)
    - Main criteria focuses on learning, in particular
      - (1) Novelty (related work) (20%)
      - (2) Experiment rigour (comparisons) (20%)
      - (3) Model complexity (competency) (20%)
      - (4) Evaluation methods (appropriate) (20%)
      - (5) Effort (not last day!) (20%)
    - Submission deliverables:
